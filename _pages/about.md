## Research Experience

### Institute of Network and Intelligent Systems                 14 May, 2023 -- 26 July, 2023

[school of Computing Summer Workshop 2023](https://sws.comp.nus.edu.sg/Home.html)

Visiting Student                                                                                                                                   Advisor: [LOW Kok Lim](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/lowkl/)

**Course: Real-Time Graphics Rendering**

- Topics: Computer Graphics
- In this workshop, students study the modern real-time rendering pipeline. It introduces modern and traditional real-time rendering techniques, and students learn to write shaders to implement these techniques for the GPU.
- The syllabus includes multiple-pass rendering, shading & reflection models, procedural texture-mapping & shading, lights & shadows, non-photorealistic rendering, deferred shading, post-rendering processing, etc.
