Hi! I'm an undergraduate student at [Sichuan University(SCU)](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science & technology (Top-notch Program, a class of 15 elite students selected from 400+) . 

Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher assistant at [Institute of Network and Intelligent Systems](https://yj-zhou.github.io/) since Sep, 2022, advised by [Prof. Yinjie Zhou](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1286/15957.htm). 

## Education

### Bachelor: Sichuan University (2021.9 ~ )

- **Major**：Computer Science and Technology, College of Computer Science
- **GPA**：3.88/4.0
- **Average Score**：91.23/100



## Research Interests

- Data Mining (Anomaly Detection, Time Series Forecasting, Recommendation System, etc)
- Representation Learning & Self-Supervised Learning

## Recent Research

### Dc2former: Dual-Constrained and Self-Corrected Transformer for Time Series Forecasting

_with [Prof. Lu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u3N8K58AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), Chengdu University of Information Technology and [Prof. Yinjie Zhou](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1286/15957.htm), Sichuan University_                                                                                                                                 

- We explored the task of noise-aware time series forecasting and addressed the vulnerability to noisy data inherent in current forecasting approaches. To achieve this, we proposed a generic learning framework with novel constrain design and an feature correction module, which helps mitigate such noise impact and achieve more stable and accurate forecasting.

### CERTD: Continuous-Enhanced and Rapid insider Threat Detection

_with Di Wu, Sichuan University and [Prof. Yinjie Zhou](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1286/15957.htm), Sichuan Unniversity_

- We investigated the insider threat detection problem in real-world scenario and proposed a machine learning-based detection system which combines continual learning technique to ensure efficient learning from data stream and achieve effective real-time detection.
