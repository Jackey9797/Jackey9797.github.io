_with [Prof. Lu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u3N8K58AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), Chengdu University of Information Technology and [Prof. Yinjie Zhou](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1286/15957.htm), Sichuan University_                                                                                                                                 

- Topics: Computer Graphics
- In this workshop, students study the modern real-time rendering pipeline. It introduces modern and traditional real-time rendering techniques, and students learn to write shaders to implement these techniques for the GPU.
- The syllabus includes multiple-pass rendering, shading & reflection models, procedural texture-mapping & shading, lights & shadows, non-photorealistic rendering, deferred shading, post-rendering processing, etc.
