- **Average Score**：91.23/100



## Research Interests

- Data Mining (Anomaly Detection, Time Series Forecasting, Recommendation System, etc)
- Representation Learning & Self-Supervised Learning

## Recent Research

### Dc2former: Dual-Constrained and Self-Corrected Transformer for Time Series Forecasting                

[school of Computing Summer Workshop 2023](https://sws.comp.nus.edu.sg/Home.html)

_with [Prof. Lu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u3N8K58AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), Chengdu University of Information Technology and [Prof. Yinjie Zhou](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/info/1286/15957.htm), Sichuan University_                                                                                                                                 

- Topics: Computer Graphics
- In this workshop, students study the modern real-time rendering pipeline. It introduces modern and traditional real-time rendering techniques, and students learn to write shaders to implement these techniques for the GPU.
- The syllabus includes multiple-pass rendering, shading & reflection models, procedural texture-mapping & shading, lights & shadows, non-photorealistic rendering, deferred shading, post-rendering processing, etc.
